# Emerald

Emerald—working title—is a super basic, super in-progress MMO game that lets you and your friends run around in virtual space (and, in the future, visit each other's virtual houses, spend coins to upgrade your avatars, send messages to each other...). Sort of a ripoff of Club Penguin.

## Tech stack used

Made with React on the frontend and Node/Express on the backend, with Socket.IO to manage realtime player movement and communication and MongoDB to store player data.

Sorry, this is my first time writing a README for one of these things. Did I do it right?
