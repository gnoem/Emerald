# Emerald

Emerald—working title—is a super basic MMO game that lets you and your friends run around in virtual space (and, in the future, visit each other's virtual houses, spend coins to upgrade your avatars, send messages to each other...). Sort of a ripoff of Club Penguin.

## Status

Very much in progress. Sign up + login functionality is solid. You can use the arrow keys to move your player around the game canvas, and player movement is synchronized across clients. Currently working on the part after login where you can customize your avatar.

## Tech stack used

Made with React on the frontend and Node/Express on the backend, with Socket.IO to manage realtime player movement and communication and MongoDB to store player data.

Sorry, this is my first time writing a README for one of these things. Did I do it right?
